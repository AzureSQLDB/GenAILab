# Generative AI with Azure SQL and REST Endpoints Lab

## Overview
Welcome to the hands-on lab where you'll learn Generative AI using Azure SQL Database and REST endpoints. This lab is designed for application developers, data scientists, and AI engineers looking to integrate advanced AI capabilities into their applications.

### Goals
- **Set up Generative AI**: Learn to integrate AI capabailities with Azure SQL Database.
- **RESTful API calls**: Understand how to make REST calls to Azure AI Content Safety and Azure OpenAI services.
- **Extend AI scenarios**: Explore Hybrid Search and Generative AI implementations.
- **Chat-driven SQL interfaces**: Implement chat-driven interfaces with SQL databases for more intelligent applications.
- **Practical tips and examples**: Apply chat-driven features in app development with real-world examples.

## Modules
1. **[Creating and Connecting to Your Free Azure SQL Database](./docs/1-create-azure-SQL-database.md)**: Get started with your own Azure SQL Database.
2. **[Creating, Embedding, and Storing in SQL Database](./docs/2-creating-embedding-and-storing-in-SQL-database.md)**: Dive into the process of embedding and storing data using SQL.
3. **[Vector Search with Vector Functions](./docs/3-vector-search-with-vector-functions.md)**: Utilize vector functions for efficient search capabilities.
4. **[Hybrid Search](./docs/4-hybrid-search.md)**: Combine the power of traditional and vector searches.
5. **[Chat Completion Using Azure OpenAI](./docs/5-chat-completion-using-azure-openai.md)**: Implement chat completions with the help of Azure OpenAI.
6. **[Using the Azure AI Content Safety](./docs/6-content-safety.md)**: Ensure content safety with Azure AI's endpoints.
